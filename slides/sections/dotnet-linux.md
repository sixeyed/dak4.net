# .NET Core in Linux containers

We'll be using Kubernetes from now on. You can deploy Kubernetes in the cloud with a mix of Linux and Windows servers, so it can run Linux and Windows containers - we could run our entire SignUp app in Kubernetes using the Docker images we've built.

But with Docker Desktop on Windows 10 you can only run Linux containers in Kubernetes.

> That's fine because the latest app upgrade migrates everything to .NET Core, so we can run on Linux.

## Remove all containers

You can switch between Linux and Windows container mode in Docker Desktop. 

Containers keep running and you can still use apps when you switch, but we don't need the Windows version.

_Remove all the Windows containers:_

```
docker container rm -f $(docker container ls -aq)
```

## Switch to Linux containers

Right-click the Docker whale icon in the taskbar, and select _Switch to Linux containers_

## Building apps with Docker Compose

Compose files can include a `build` section for each service, specifying the details you'd normally run in `docker image build`.

The file [docker-compose-build-linux.yml](./ci/docker-compose-build-linux.yml) has build details for Linux versions of each component.

Compose files like this are used in CI/CD pipelines, so your whole app gets built and shared with `docker-compose build` and `docker-compose push`.

---

## Build the Linux app versions

There's a new .NET Core version of the [save message handler](./src/SignUp.MessageHandlers.SaveProspectCore), and a new [Razor pages front-end web project](./src/SignUp.Web.Core).

Those are .NET Core 3.1 apps, so they can be built to run in Docker containers on Windows or Linux (or Arm processor like the Raspberry Pi - but save that for another day).

_Build the Linux versions:_

```
docker-compose -f ./ci/docker-compose-build-linux.yml build
```

---

## Using multi-arch images

The [.NET Core save handler Dockerfile](./docker/backend-async-messaging/save-handler-core/Dockerfile) and the [Razor web app Dockerfile](./docker/frontend-web/signup-web-core/Dockerfile) use Microsoft's .NET Core images to build and package the app.

Those are multi-architecture images, which means there are different variants with the same image name. When you use one of those containers Docker will pull the matching variant for your current runtime.

On Windows you'll build a Windows Docker image, and on Linux it will be a Linux image - from the same Dockerfile and source code.

---

## How about the other components?

SQL Server is supported on Linux too now, and Microsoft publish a Linux Docker image.

The [NATS](https://hub.docker.com/_/nats) message queue is a multi-arch images on Docker Hub, so we can use the same image name in Linux container mode to work with the Linux variant.

And we van use the official [Traefik](https://hub.docker.com/_/traefik), [Elasticsearch](https://hub.docker.com/_/elasticsearch) and [Kibana](https://hub.docker.com/_/kibana) images.

So we have everything we need to deploy the app to Kubernetes.

---

## But we should test it first

Docker Desktop is running in Linux container mode, so we can run everything locally using Linux images and Docker Compose.

The [v5 Linux Compose file](./app/v5-linux.yml) doesn't have any Swarm specs, so this is fine for a development environment or a smoke test.

_Run the Linux version:_

```
docker-compose -f ./app/v5-linux.yml up -d
```

---

## Check out the app

A quick test will do...

> Open up http://localhost:8020 as usual

---

## Understanding the limits of Compose

Docker Compose is a client-side tool, it uses the Docker API to check what's running and to create or update containers. The Docker Engine isn't aware that the containers are related.

And the deployment we're using doesn't have any availability settings, so if a container exits it won't be restarted.

```
docker container rm -f app_signup-web_1
```

> Now http://localhost:8020/app is broken

## Orchestration and Kubernetes

This is where container orchestration comes in, where you join multiple servers together which can all run containers to give you scale and high availability.

Kubernetes is the most popular orchestrator, and we'll use it to run our modernized .NET app.
